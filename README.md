## Abstract
The is a personal project of mine! The first one I've done for fun and it was a blast to create. This web app showcases all of my projects that I've created from the start of my software developer journey. It also has a brief about me section. You can view the deployed website [here](https://janika-codes-stuff.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - React
  - Cypress
  - Express.js

To run the application from a local server:

1) Clone down repo
2) Cd into `portfolio-site`

2) Cypress browser will load, choose a test and see the results

## Code Architecture

  The React arquitecture is based on two class components and three functional components. The class components holds state and are in charge of the network requests, while the functional components just render information passed down as props.
